    <p id="point">NBA's 3-point revolution: How 1 shot is changing the game</p>

        Miami Heat assistant Chris Quinn likes to remind coach Erik Spoelstra about one of the best regular-season wins in franchise history.
        It was a three-point victory in Charlotte in which Chris Bosh put the Heat ahead with an and-one drive with 23.5 seconds left.
      </p> 
      <p id="poin">
        It wasn't great win because of Bosh's performance or the opponent, though that was the best Charlotte team since the bird of the Bobcats.
        No, it was a great win "because we won on the road in the' modern-day era," Spoelstra says, "without making a 3-points field goal"  
        Indeed, that was the last time any team has won a game which it didin't make a 3. The Heat were 0-for-9 from beyond there arc.
      </p>
      <p id="poin">
        "There's no way," Spoelstra laughs, "you can do that now".
        yes, the game has changed a lot since then. But "then" was only five years ago onfeb. 5,2016 in Charlotte.
        The profileration od 3-points shooting is a story that's been written before. But it's not a stroy that's over.
        The league-wide 3-piont rate (the percentage of all field goal attempts that have come from beyond the arc) has increased in each of the last 10 seasons,
        rising from 22,2% IN 2010-11 39,2% last season. And its's increased more in the last five years than it did in the pervious five.

        PORTLAND, Ore. - For all the handwringing this summer over Damian Lillard's happiness in Portland, the Trail Blazers guard is staying put, hopeful the team's moves will pay off.
        The biggest, of course, was parting ways with coach Terry Stotts after nine seasons. Portland hired Chauncey bilups, who has no prior expierance as an NBA head coach.
        While the team didn't strike any splashy offseason deals. Lillard belivies the Blazers are in a better place, "Obviously at the end of last season, I wantend to see our roster improve,
        I wantend us to have a better chance to win" lilllard said. "And we had"
      </p>
      <p id="poin">
        Portland finished 42-30 last season and earned the sixth seed in the Western Conference. The team won 10 of its final 12 regular-season games but the playoffs ended quickly with the Blazers eliminated by Denver in the opening round.
        Lillard is entering his 10th NBA season. The closest he’s come to a title was a trip to the Western Conference finals in 2019.
      </p> 
      <p id="poin">
        He ranked third in the NBA with an average of 28,8 points last season, and was in the top 10 with 
        7.5 assists. But it may be Portland's last season with their All-Star and Olympian, unsless the team gets redults.
        "I think we all know we've got to get oer the hump," Nurkic said.

        LeBron James has been in Los Angeles for three seasons, and injuries damaged two of them. The third? He won a title. See the trend here? If LeBron and his fellow veterans,
        Anthony Davis (whose injury cost the Lakers last season) and Russell Westbrook, can survive the obstacle course known as the 82-game grind and remain fresh throughout the postseason,
        there’s no reason the Lakers can’t add another title in the LeBron era.
        The biggest reason for optimism is the arrival of Westbrook. Obviously, there’s no guarantee Russ will be the missing piece,
        and reasonable doubts were raised when the Lakers obtained him from Washington. Still, for all of his flaws (mostly shooting),
        Russ is a demon on the court and can relieve LeBron of the ball-handling chores. Plus, LeBron and Davis are easy to compliment,
        for the most part; neither player demands the ball and in the case of LeBron, he’s the most unselfish big-time scorer in NBA history.
      </p>
      <p id="poin">
        The Lakers clearly are trying to maximize LeBron’s remaining years and that’s why they added Westbrook and also veteran help in Carmelo Anthony,
        Rajon Rondo and Dwight Howard. It’s a rotation that can measure up to most if not all others in the NBA this season. Unless the grind gets to them.
      </p>
      <p id="poin">
        BIGGEST QUESTION -
        Beyond LeBron, Westbrook and Davis, the Lakers are putting their faith in a small core of young players, hoping they can fill roles and show growth. Therefore, 
        this is a golden opportunity for Kendrick Nunn and Malik Monk, who arrived in free agency, to hit their stride. Nunn and Monk both showed promise in Miami and Charlotte,
        respectively, just not enough to gain the full confidence of those teams. What can they do on a win-now club like the Lakers?
